# Deployable-Knowledge

## Knowledge Graph retrieval

The server-side `src/lib/server/knowledge-graph` module adds LightRAG neighborhood retrieval and PathRAG relational traversal on top of the application's existing document pipeline. It reads chunks already created by `rag/parse/chunker-semantic.ts`, uses the existing hybrid search for seed chunks, and returns graph evidence through the normal chat citation flow.

Choose **Knowledge Graph** in the Search Settings window, then ask a question in chat. Newly ingested documents automatically invalidate the in-memory graph cache.

Run the focused graph test with:

```bash
npm run test:knowledge-graph
```

**Version vA0.3.0**

Offline‑first retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) stack for disconnected or bandwidth‑constrained environments.

## Overview

Deployable‑Knowledge bundles a local vector store, prompt management and a lightweight web UI around a pluggable large‑language model.  Documents are embedded locally, the frontend is developed in [Sveltekit](https://svelte.dev), the backend is written in [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org).

## Features

- **Document ingestion** for PDF and plaintext sources
- **ChromaDB** vector store with sentence‑transformer embeddings
- **Chat and search** endpoints with optional streaming responses
- **Configurable prompts** and persona editing
- **Authentication middleware** with session and CSRF protection

## Quick Start for Development

```bash
# First time setup (don't do this everytime)
npm install
npm run db:generate

npm run db:migrate # to be run if there were upstream database changes

# After and every other startup run 
npm run dev
```
